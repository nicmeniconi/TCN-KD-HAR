# Optimizing Unimodal Human Activity Recognition TCNs with Knowledge Distillation

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in advancing applications across healthcare, gaming, and industrial automation. HAR models leverage data modalities such as positional, angular, and multimodal inputs to accurately and efficiently capture human movements. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each modality, along with innovative fusion methods, enables the development of robust and efficient HAR systems<sup>[1](#references)</sup>.

## Applications of Multimodal HAR Systems

Multimodal HAR systems enhance activity recognition in diverse domains:
- **Tele-rehabilitation**: Remote patient monitoring with positional and angular data enables personalized therapy<sup>[2](#references)</sup>.
- **Assistive Technologies**: Multimodal models improve real-time decision-making in devices like exoskeletons and prosthetics<sup>[3](#references)</sup>.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: These systems support intuitive interfaces for gaming, virtual reality, and robotics<sup>[4](#references)</sup>.

## Data Modalities in Motion Capture

### Single-Modality Data
- **Positional Data**: Efficient for gross motor movements but less effective for fine-grained actions<sup>[5](#references)</sup>.
- **Angular Data**: Captures nuanced limb rotations but can suffer from drift and calibration issues<sup>[6](#references)</sup>.

### Multimodal Data
Multimodal systems combine positional and angular data to capture global motion patterns and localized joint behavior, improving accuracy and robustness. The VIDIMU dataset demonstrates this integration by using video and IMU data<sup>[7](#references)</sup>.

## Advantages of Multimodal Models

Multimodal HAR models address key limitations of single-modality systems:
- **Robustness**: Compensate for modality-specific noise<sup>[8](#references)</sup>.
- **Generalizability**: Perform well across diverse activities<sup>[9](#references)</sup>.
- **Temporal Understanding**: Enrich recognition of static postures and dynamic transitions<sup>[10](#references)</sup>.

Additionally, multimodal models aid in optimizing single-modality systems through feature transfer, data augmentation, and model simplification.

## Teacher Training and Student Pre-Training

### Input Modalities and Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: Joint position and angle data from the VIDIMU dataset.
- **Observation Durations**: 0.5s, 0.75s, 1.5s, and 4.0s.
- **Preprocessing**: Min-max normalization was applied separately for each modality using training set statistics.

### Model Architectures
The ResNet-based architectures were adapted for temporal data:
- **Pos_ResNet**: Joint position input.
- **Ang_ResNet**: Joint angle input.
- **AngPos_ResNet**: Combined input via parallel streams.

### Training and Optimization
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss.
- **Optimizer**: Adam.
- **Scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau.
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 30 epochs.

## Initial Training Results and Discussion

### Performance Across Observation Windows
- Shorter windows (0.5s, 0.75s) achieved higher performance due to reduced temporal complexity.
- Longer windows (1.5s, 4.0s) showed diminishing returns.

### Model Comparison
- **Pos_ResNet**: Strong with position-only data.
- **Ang_ResNet**: Less effective for longer windows.
- **AngPos_ResNet**: Consistently outperformed single-modality models.
