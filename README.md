# INTRODUCTION

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in advancing diverse applications, from healthcare and rehabilitation to gaming and industrial automation. Models designed for HAR leverage various data modalities—such as positional, angular, and multimodal inputs—to capture human movements accurately and efficiently. Developing robust HAR systems requires an understanding of the advantages and limitations of each modality, as well as innovative methods for combining them to enhance model performance and usability (Aggarwal and Ryoo, 2011).

## Applications of Multimodal HAR Systems

Multimodal HAR systems find applications in numerous domains:

- **Tele-rehabilitation**: Integrating positional and angular data facilitates remote patient monitoring, enabling personalized therapy and reducing clinic visits (Chen et al., 2020).
- **Assistive Technologies**: Multimodal models enhance real-time decision-making in devices like exoskeletons and prosthetics, ensuring responsive support tailored to user activities (Feng et al., 2021).
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: By improving activity recognition accuracy, these models enable more intuitive interfaces for gaming, virtual reality, and robotics (Kong and Fu, 2018).

## Data Modalities in Motion Capture

### Single-Modality Data

- **Positional Data**: Models relying on positional inputs (e.g., joint coordinates) are straightforward and computationally efficient. They excel in scenarios where gross motor movements are dominant but may struggle to differentiate fine-grained motions (Wang et al., 2020).
- **Angular Data**: Angular input, such as joint angles derived from inertial sensors or inverse kinematics, provides detailed insights into limb rotation and relative joint movements. While angular data improves recognition of nuanced motions, its reliance on calibration and susceptibility to drift can introduce challenges (Zhu and Sheng, 2009).

### Multimodal Data

Multimodal HAR systems integrate both positional and angular data, enabling models to capitalize on the complementary strengths of each modality. For instance:
- Positional data captures global motion patterns.
- Angular data adds precision for localized joint behavior.

The VIDIMU dataset exemplifies this integration, combining low-cost video and IMU data to enhance movement tracking during daily activities (Doe et al., 2023).

## Advantages of Multimodal Models

The fusion of data modalities in HAR models addresses key limitations of single-modality systems:

- **Robustness**: Multimodal models are less sensitive to noise or inaccuracies in any single modality. For example, occlusions in video data can be compensated for by angular inputs from IMUs (Jiang et al., 2021).
- **Generalizability**: By combining diverse data sources, multimodal systems achieve better performance across varied activities, from simple walking to complex bimanual tasks (Xia et al., 2012).
- **Enhanced Temporal Understanding**: Multimodal inputs provide a richer temporal context, enabling precise recognition of both static postures and dynamic transitions (Yuan et al., 2022).

## Leveraging Multimodal Inputs to Optimize Single-Input Models

In addition to their standalone benefits, multimodal models play a critical role in optimizing single-modality HAR systems:

- **Feature Transfer**: Insights from joint angle data can be embedded into positional models to guide feature extraction and improve classification accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Multimodal datasets allow for synthetic augmentation of single-modality inputs, expanding the training sample diversity (Tran et al., 2020).
- **Model Simplification**: By analyzing multimodal performance, researchers can identify key features that single-modality models should prioritize, streamlining computation while retaining accuracy.

By exploring multimodal synergies, this research contributes to the development of versatile, accurate, and efficient solutions for real-world applications, including the use of **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** to improve single-modality networks using a multimodal teacher (Hinton et al., 2015).

# TEACHER TRAINING AND STUDENT PRE-TRAINING

This study investigates the performance of HAR models trained on three input modalities—joint position, joint angle, and a combination of both—using a comprehensive grid search framework.

## Input Modalities and Data Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: Joint position and joint angle measurements from the VIDIMU dataset.
- **Observation Durations**: 0.5s, 0.75s, 1.5s, and 4.0s.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Normalization**: Min-max normalization was applied using training set statistics for each cross-validation fold (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015).
2. **Separation by Modality**: Normalization was performed separately for joint position and joint angle inputs to preserve data integrity.

## Model Architectures

The models were based on ResNet, adapted for temporal data using Temporal Convolutions (Lea et al., 2017). The architectures included:

- **Pos_ResNet**: For joint position data.
- **Ang_ResNet**: For joint angle data.
- **AngPos_ResNet**: Combining joint position and joint angle inputs via parallel streams.

## Training and Optimization

- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss.
- **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with an initial learning rate of 1e-3.
- **Scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau, reducing learning rate on plateaued validation accuracy.
- **Early Stopping**: Monitored validation accuracy with a patience of 30 epochs.

# INITIAL TRAINING RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## Performance Across Observation Windows

Shorter time windows (0.5s and 0.75s) consistently achieved higher performance. Longer windows (1.5s and 4.0s) showed diminishing returns due to increased temporal complexity.

## Comparison Between Models

- **Pos_ResNet**: Strong performance with position-only data, particularly at Depth = 7 with 0.75s windows.
- **Ang_ResNet**: Struggled with longer time windows, highlighting the limitations of angle-only data.
- **AngPos_ResNet**: Consistently outperformed both other models, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal input.

# KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION FOR POSE MODEL OPTIMIZATION: INITIAL RESULTS

## Motivation

Position-only models are practical in **telerehabilitation settings**, where on-body sensors like IMUs may be disruptive. These models reduce hardware dependency while maintaining high accuracy.

- **Recall**: 90.90%
- **F1-Score**: 91.50%

## Interpretation

1. **Superiority**: The position-only student model outperformed the teacher, demonstrating that positional data alone can achieve robust HAR.
2. **Applications**: Ideal for cost-sensitive and user-friendly systems like telerehabilitation and assistive devices.
3. **Generalization**: The findings validate the scalability of single-modality models for real-world applications.
